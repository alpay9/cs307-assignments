# Operating Systems (CS307) Programming Assignments

Here are my Operating Systems (CS307) programming assignments. <br>

- In the first assignment, simulated a shell command execution. Used pipes to communicate between different processes. <br>
- In the second assignment, improved the first assignment and implemented a shell simulator that allows multiple commands simultaneously. Synchronization is preserved using a mutex. <br>
- In the third assignment, implemented a concurrent rideshare simulation. As synchronization primitives, used semaphores. <br>
- In the fourth assignment, implemented a heap management application. It simulates how a heap gives spaces to different processes when they request space and how a memory space gets freed. <br>

Note: I got a perfect score on all of the assignments.
